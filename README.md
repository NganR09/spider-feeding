# spider-feeding

This was my first project using Unreal Engine 4.
Using assests from Mixamo and some that my teacher supplied, I was able to create a game where you need to keep your spider fed ot it'll die.
This project is more of an experimental one where I was testing what I could implement successfully into my game, leading up to our final major project.
